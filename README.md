Framework     : Textual (Python TUI Framework)
==================================================

📌 Overview

VARTALAP is a terminal-based social networking prototype developed using the
Textual framework in Python. The project demonstrates how core social
media functionality—such as posts, likes, comments, chats, and profiles—can be
implemented entirely within a command-line interface.

The application is designed as an academic prototype and focuses on:

Event-driven programming

State management in TUIs

Keyboard-based interaction design

Clean, modular Python architecture

🚀 Features

📜 Scrollable post feed (Packet Stream)

❤️ Like posts

💬 Comment on posts

📝 Create new posts

🔐 Local chat system (session-based)

👤 User profile screen

⌨️ Keyboard navigation (no mouse required)

🖥️ Cyber-themed terminal UI
